The distance from the center to any point on the circle is called the radius. The area of a circle represents the amount of space it covers.\n\n**Formula for Area of a Circle:**\n\nThe area of a circle with radius r is given by the formula:\n\n```\nArea = πr²\n```\n\nwhere π is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159.\n\n**Solution Summary:**\n\nTo find the area of a circle, simply substitute the given radius into the formula and evaluate the expression.\n\n**Practical Example:**\n\nFind the area of a circle with a radius of 5 inches.\n\n```\nArea = πr²\n= π(5)²\n= 25π\n≈ 78.54 square inches\n```\n\n**Step-by-Step Problem-Solving Method:**\n\n1. **Identify the radius:** Determine the length of the radius, which is the distance from the center to any point on the circle.\n2. **Substitute into the formula:** Replace the variable r in the area formula with the given radius value.\n3. **Evaluate the expression:** Multiply the radius by itself and then by π to calculate the area.\n4. **Simplify the result:** If necessary, round the answer to the appropriate number of decimal places or simplify using other mathematical operations.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The area of a circle can also be expressed in terms of the diameter, which is twice the radius. The formula for area using the diameter is:\n```\nArea = (π/4)d²\n```\nwhere d is the diameter.\n\n* The circumference of a circle (the distance around the circle) is related to the area by the formula:\n```\nCircumference = 2πr\n```\n\n**Practice Problems:**\n\n1. Find the area of a circle with a radius of 3 centimeters.\n2. Calculate the area of a circle whose diameter is 10 feet.\n3. A pizza has a radius of 12 inches. What is the area of the pizza?"

It is calculated by multiplying the length of the rectangle by its width.\n\n**Formula:**\n\n`Area = Length × Width`\n\n**Unit of Measurement:**\n\nThe area of a rectangle is measured in square units, typically square centimeters (cm²), square meters (m²), or square feet (ft²).\n\n**Steps to Find the Area of a Rectangle:**\n\n1. **Identify the length and width:** Measure the length (longest side) and width (shortest side) of the rectangle in the given unit.\n2. **Multiply the length by the width:** Use the formula `Area = Length × Width` to calculate the area.\n\n**Example:**\n\nFind the area of a rectangle with a length of 5 cm and a width of 3 cm.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n`Area = Length × Width`\n`Area = 5 cm × 3 cm`\n`Area = 15 cm²`\n\n**Problem-Solving Method:**\n\n1. **Understand the problem:** Ensure that you have all the necessary information to find the area (length and width).\n2. **Identify the relevant formula:** Use the formula `Area = Length × Width`.\n3. **Substitute the given values:** Replace the length and width in the formula with their given values.\n4. **Perform the calculation:** Multiply the length by the width to find the area.\n5. **State the answer:** Include the correct unit of measurement in your answer.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* If the rectangle is a square, the length and width will be equal. The area of a square is calculated as `Area = Side × Side`.\n* The area of composite rectangles can be found by breaking them down into individual rectangles and calculating the area of each part.\n* The area of a rectangle can be used to calculate other measurements, such as perimeter and volume."
